# Patient_Decentralised_Record_System_By_-BlockChain
To develop a BlockChain solution for Patient Decentralised Record System for Hospitals in an area


# OBJECTIVE
"Patient Decentralized Record System By BlockChain : In this project we are aiming to develop a blockchain based solution for patients decentralised record system for hospitals in an area. In this project we are using Blockchain as a service (BaaS). With this projet we are trying to bring each and every patients medical data on a Blockchain network along with collaboration of hospitals which can see patients record only with the permission of patient private key."

# PROBLEM DESCIPTION
"Problem we are solving : 1) Problem in current system is that there is no decentralized  system for maintaining patients record across the various hospitals in India , and if the records are available they are in centralized system of hospital which they don't share.  2) The current system in our public health care deals with the records in file format which needs to be maintained by the patient as well as hospital in form of documents. 3) If any doctor requires to see the past prescriptions(or the past medical history) of the patient , he/she solely depends on the patients paper files(called "parcha").  4) Doctor doesn't have any system from where he/she can check that complete  previous prescriptions and treatments in one click. 5) The Transfer of patient from one hospital/institute to another creates a overhead of copying the data from the patients old record to new record."

# IMPORTANCE
"Importance of our problem : To resolve the above mentioned problem we are providing a solution which is Secure, Cross Hospital Platform, 24x7 Available, scalable and remove the tension of carrying big files and maintains the integrity of patients medical record to make sure that the Data is Authentic."

# IDEA/SOLUTION
> "for the above mentioned problem we are providing solution as follow: 1) For maintaining privacy and confidentiality we have come up with the solution of Blockchain and Keys (private and public key). Public key will be shared with the hospitals to search the patients record and get the data and private key will be used to unlock the highly confidential patients medical data. thus by this confidentiality and integrity of the records will be maintained as hospitals have no role to access that record unless patients give it concern to view. 2) when any new patient register at the hospital the system will make its entry in the public blockchain and make a block of that person and it will generate 2 keys (public and private). 3) Public key will be shared with the hospitals and private key is used to encrypt the Medical information. 4) When a patients arrive in any hospital the doctor can search for his records in the blockchain with the help of public key and all the block corresponds to the patients will be displayed i.e. the whole medical history will be displayed. 5) This platform will be available 24x7. 6) Our solution is scalable as we can expand the blockchain and actual data will be stored hospital wise at there respective centers but that transaction of data will be done through blockchain as a service."
